# zeek

A few useful scripts in centralized location:

Entropy and File Extraction 
 - Taken from BrashEndeavours (https://github.com/BrashEndeavours) within only very minor modifications to be compatible with zeek.


JA3 and HASSH
 - Taken from (https://github.com/salesforce/ja3/).

add-json
 - Enables output to both text and json logs, not ideal in production environment, but useful for testing and education environments.

zeek_logs (cslv0.2)
 - Updated zeek log cheat sheet for those scripts /plugins commonly used by the CSL.  Will be updated later to include additional log file types or additional fields due to other scripts.
