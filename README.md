# zeek

A few useful scripts in centralized location for manual installation, not as useful now with zkg.  Both entropy scripts have been moved to their own repository to be used with zkg.

Entropy and File Extraction 
 - Taken from BrashEndeavours (https://github.com/BrashEndeavours) within only very minor modifications to be compatible with zeek.


JA3 and HASSH
 - Taken from (https://github.com/salesforce/ja3/).

add-json
 - Enables output to both text and json logs, not ideal to have both in production environment, but useful for testing and education environments.
